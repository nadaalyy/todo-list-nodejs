# Todo List Node.js â€“ DevOps Task

## Part 1 - Dockerize the application, CI Pipeline with Docker and GitHub Actions

###  Step 1: Clone the Repository
- Started by cloning the following repository to my local machine:https://github.com/Ankit6098/Todo-List-nodejs

### Step 2: Configure MongoDB
- Created a MongoDB cluster using MongoDB Atlas.  
Then, update the `.env` file in the project with my MongoDB URI:

### Step 3: Dockerize the Application
- Created a `Dockerfile` to containerize the Node.js app.  
Then, built and tested the Docker image (node-app) locally:

![Dockerize the Application](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5ff5322-1494-45f2-943d-7958de0cd42b)

- After that, tested the image by running a container named "node-app-container"

- The container also appears as running in Docker Desktop, confirming that the app is successfully containerized and deployed.

- The application became accessible at :http://localhost:4000

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: GitHub Actions to create a CI pipeline
- Created a docker repository on Docker Hub.  
- Used GitHub Actions to create a CI pipeline that builds the image and pushes it to
- Used the `docker.yml` file in the CI/CD pipeline to build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub
a private docker registry.

- At the end of Part 1, I had a working CI pipeline that pushes the updated Docker image to a the registry automatically whenever I push changes to the GitHub repo.

## Part 2 - Creating a Linux VM on your local machine and using Ansible to configure the machine

###  Step 1: Creating the Red Hat Linux VM
- Created a Red Hat Linux virtual machine on my local machine using vmware
- The VM was configured with the IP address and SSH access enabled (the IP address of the VM is: 192.168.72.128)

###  Step 2: Setting Up Ansible on Local Machine
- Installed Ansible on my local machine (the control node)
- Created an inventory file `inventory.ini` with the IP address and SSH details of the VM

 ###  Step 3: Writing the Ansible Playbook
 - Created a playbook file `setup-docker.yml` to automate the configuration steps
 - The playbook installs required packages, adds Docker repository, and installs Docker on the Red Hat VM.
 - Ran the Ansible playbook:

- Verified that Docker was installed and running successfully on the VM:

## Part 3 - Running the Application with Docker Compose and Auto-Update

 ###  Step 1:  Preparing the Application on the VM
 - Created the `docker-compose.yml`file that defines the required services and containers

###  Step 2:  Running Docker Compose
 - Pulling the image and starting the container :

###  Step 3: Enabling Continuous Image Update and health check :
- To continuously check for changes in the image on the Docker registry, I chose Watchtower as the update automation tool:
- Pulled the Watchtower image,ran Watchtower as a container, monitoring all running containers.The setup checks for new images every 30 seconds and updates the containers if any changes are found.

- Accessed the running application via browser using the public IP of the RedHat VM on port 4000 to confirm that it's working properly:

## Part 4 - Running the same Node.js application using Kubernetes instead of Docker Compose

 ###  Step 1:  Install Kubernetes (Minikube)
- On the RedHat VM, Minikube was installed (a local Kubernetes cluster tool) to set up a single-node Kubernetes environment.
- kubectl was also installed to interact with the cluster.

 ###  Step 2:  Creating `todo-deployment.yml` and `todo-service.yml` files

  - Created  `todo-deployment.yml` file to define a Deployment for the Node.js app.It specifies the image, number of replicas, and container port.
  - Created  `todo-service.yml` file to expose the Node.js app using a NodePort.
  - Accessing the Node.js app in the browser using the VMâ€™s IP address and the exposed NodePort:
